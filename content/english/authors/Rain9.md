I am a passionate software engineer with expertise in full-stack development. Focusing on web technologies and system architecture, I enjoy building efficient and scalable applications. I'm particularly interested in JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem, big data, and artificial intelligence. In my free time, I write technical blogs and explore emerging technologies to stay at the forefront of innovation.
