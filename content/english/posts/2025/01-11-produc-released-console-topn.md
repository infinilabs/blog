## **Spotlight: Introducing the TopN Feature**

### **What is TopN?**
TopN, introduced in **Console v1.28.0**, allows you to quickly identify the top-ranking data points for critical metrics across multiple dimensions. Designed for performance optimization and decision-making, TopN offers faster, more precise monitoring even as cluster sizes grow.

In the past, monitoring solutions often struggled to handle large clusters with numerous nodes and indices, making it hard to pinpoint issues like the busiest nodes or the most delayed queries. With TopN, Console delivers an intuitive, efficient way to analyze your clusters, empowering users with:

- Multi-dimensional insights.
- Visualizations like **treemaps** for quick anomaly detection.
- Easy dynamic metric switching for deeper analysis.

### **Key Features**

#### **1. Multi-Dimensional Metrics Support**
Monitor critical metrics across indices, nodes, and shards:
- **Index-Level Metrics:** Indexing rate, query rate, indexing latency, query latency, etc.
- **Node-Level Metrics:** Indexing rate, query rate, CPU usage, JVM usage, etc.
- **Shard-Level Metrics:** Indexing rate, query rate, indexing latency, query latency, etc.

#### **2. Intuitive Visualizations**
- **Table View:** Displays detailed TopN data points.
- **Treemap View:** Visualizes data distribution with color and size dimensions for quick anomaly detection.
- **Dynamic Metric Switching:** Easily toggle between dimensions like size and color for customized insights.

#### **3. Customization and Extensibility**
- **Built-in Templates:** Preconfigured metric templates for common scenarios.
- **User-Defined Rules:** Create custom metric calculation rules for personalized analysis.

---

### **Use Cases**
- **Performance Bottleneck Analysis:** Identify hotspots during indexing or querying for faster troubleshooting.
- **Resource Optimization:** Detect resource-intensive nodes or shards to improve cluster efficiency.
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Gain actionable insights for better operational and business outcomes.
